# HydroPower_Fuzzy
Many factors related to river runoff are vague, subjective and difficult to quantify. The fuzzy logic method is very useful for such problem solving approach such as small hydro power generation. The rule base and membership functions have a great influence on the performance and efficacy of the plant and also to optimize the small hydro power generation in the high altitude region particularly in India. The fuzzy linguistic variable performance can be easily characterized by common terms. The paper initially presents a new Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) method for safe reservoir control of dams through spillway gates. Finally it presents FLC method for turbine valve to control the water flow through turbine for hydro power generation. Thus it shows overall effective control and operation of the mechanical equipments in a hydro electric power generation project with FLC and its usefulness. The hardware of control system for fuzzifiers and defuzzifiers can be designed according to the need of system. All above proposed simplified models uses " Tabu Search Algorithm " , " Fuzzy Delphi Method " and " Mamdani Inference Method " to evaluate using manual " C.O.G. Defuzzification " and MATLAB FIS editor validation.
